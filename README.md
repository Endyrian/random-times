#random-times

##About the Project

As part of an ongoing worldbuilding project, I created a character with the ability to rewind time whenever a certain condition was met. When this happened, they would have a choice of several options for how far back to go, with more options for shorter lengths of time. This program was created to help me decide what those options would be.

###Built With

This project uses python's standard `math` and `random` libraries. No other libraries are used.

##Getting Started

###Prerequisites

To run this program, you will need a python interpreter.

###Installation

To install, download `rand_times.py`.

##Usage

To use, run `rand_times.py` in the command line. When prompted, enter a maximum length of time as a floating point number of days. You should see a list of times printed out in `days:hours:minutes:seconds` format.
